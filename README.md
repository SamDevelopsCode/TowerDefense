A simple tower defense game to learn the Unity Engine. Towers can be chosen, then visualized before placing. They can be upgraded up to 3 times using currency. There are multiple enemy types on the backend, such as light (fast), medium (balanced), heavy (slow). There is an enemy spawn system in place to use ScriptableObjects to create groups and then waves out of those groups. I focused a bit more on making designer friendly systems. The visual effects are missing but the towers can acquire targets and attack, killing enemies. Currency is given when an enemy is killed and health is lost to the player's base when and enemy successfully makes it to the base.
