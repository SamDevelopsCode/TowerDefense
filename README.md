**Technologies: Unity \
Languages: C#**

A simple tower defense game to learn the Unity Engine. 

## **Features -**

**Towers:**
  - Multiple types can be chosen, then visualized before placing. 
  - Each tower upgraded up to 3 times. 
  
**Currency:**
  - Gained when an enemy is killed.
  
**Player Base:**
  - Health is lost when an enemy successfully makes it to the base.  
 
**Enemies:**
  - Uses ScriptableObjects to create groups and then waves out of those groups. I wanted to put some focus more on making designer friendly systems.
  - Multiple enemy types, such as light (fast), medium (balanced), heavy (slow). 


*Attack VFX missing but the towers can acquire targets and attack, killing enemies.*
